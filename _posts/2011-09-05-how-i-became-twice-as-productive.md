Though I had known about about 2x speed button on the iPod application forever, however the two times I ha tried to use it I found it hard to listen to.
What I always said I needed was a 1.5 speed for the iPod app and had actually requested this from Apple and almost switched to a different
podcast app that supported multiple speeds. How wrong I was, what I really needed was to trust Steve and bear down and listen to a couple
podcasts at double speed. Now I find it very odd to listen to any podcasts at normal speed, and almost wish there was a 2.5 speed!
And now, at least in listening to podcasts, I am twice as productive as I used to be. If only there where such shortcuts elsewhere!
