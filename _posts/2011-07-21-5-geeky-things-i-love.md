1. [Rdio](http://rd.io) Instant access to millions of tunes.  Amazing value for money.
1. [PhpStorm](http://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/) Makes programming in PHP a joy again.
1. [Kindle](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002Y27P3M/ref=sv_kinh_0) The readability and the weight are what makes this the killer ebook reader.
1. [iPhone](http://www.apple.com/iphone/) Ok, maybe some of the glow has rubbed off, but I still couldn't live without it (and with Rdio it makes the iPhone even better).
1. [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/) It's kind of amazing how Mintty, Git, and Node have brought Cygwin back into my life after all these years.
