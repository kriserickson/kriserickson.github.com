## Introduction

A while ago I got an email from a [Recipe Folder](https://recipe-folder.com) user asking how to get the Google Home
integration working with Recipe Folder.  I have no idea why they thought that there was an integration, but it got me
thinking, maybe I should add one.  I hadn't looked at [Google Home](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Home) or
[Amazon Alexa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Alexa) development before, but I thought it might be fun to add
at least Google Home integration (I own a Google Home but not an Alexa yet) to Recipe Folder.  So I responded to the
user saying that there was currently no integration but it was something that I was going to look into.

So I started looking into writing a Google Home app.  A bit of research, and I discovered that you don't really write
Google Home app's, but you write [Google Actions](https://developers.google.com/actions/) that run on any of the Google Assistants (the Google Home being one,
but also there is an assistant built into all modern Android Phones and Tablets).  Most of the tutorials that I 
discovered were built around [api.ai](https://dialogflow.com/) which is now called dialogflow, and used Google
Cloud platform to run.  I needed access to all the data on my own servers, so I wanted to write a stand-alone that didn't
require outside services (other than the Google Action API, obviously).  While there were some example apps from
Google in the [Actions of Google Github Page](https://github.com/actions-on-google), these mostly seemed to be using
Firebase or Google cloud, so I figured that someone should write a simple tutorial on how to get a Google Action
running on your own server from nothing.  We are going to write a very simple game (in the next article) you can quickly play with your
Google Assistant, [Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock](https://bigbangtheory.wikia.com/wiki/Rock_Paper_Scissors_Lizard_Spock), in the third
article in the series we are going keep track of your winnings and losings over time so we will required a login.  
To this end we are going to include [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) and [Account Linking](https://developers.google.com/actions/identity/account-linking), 
so we can store those wins and losses (and because one of the larger hassles I had writing my integration was implementing the OAuth 2 integration).

## Intended Audience

Although anyone who has some experience with command line tooling and programming should be able to follow this article, it assumes that you
have some familiarity with [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/bm/docs/Web/JavaScript), and
you will need a Google Account.  Having a Google Home for testing is nice, but is not required as you can test your app on either your
Phone or the Simulator.  If you are unfamiliar with [modern JavaScript](http://es6-features.org/#Constants) ([ES6 or ES2015](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript#6th_Edition_-_ECMAScript_2015)), I will explain some of the new features as we go along.  For now just know that
[const](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const) is a var that cannot be changed after being 
initialized (if you want to read it as var, go ahead), and other things will be explained as we run into them.  Although this looks like
a fairly long article (and that is the reason it is broken into 3 parts), getting your first application up and running should take
under half an hour if everything goes right.

## Required Tooling

We are going to do this in nodejs, using the [Action on Google Node Client Library](https://github.com/actions-on-google/actions-on-google-nodejs),
[ngrok.io](https://ngrok.com) to provide a tunnel from the open web, to our application.  In the end, we will us [MongoDb](https://www.mongodb.com/) to store 
that user login and the score from the games.  The web server that servers both the JSON, and the login web pages is going to be Express, and we will be using modern
Javascript so you will need NodeJS at least 8 installed.  The more OAuth and Mongo is coming in a later installment, so
for now just make sure that you have the following installed:

1. [NodeJS LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (8.9.4 at the time of writing this, but feel free to go with 9.5 which is the current).
2. [NGrok client](https://ngrok.com/download) and have that available on your path.  You will need to sign up for a Free Account as well.
3. [GActions CLI](https://developers.google.com/actions/tools/gactions-cli) and have that available on your path.  You will need a Google Account, and if you have never used any Google API's or Cloud Services you may be required to click through some agreements.

I'm doing all of this on Windows, but it will certainly work on OSX or Linux.  I'm also using [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/), 
but any editor can be used, however I recommend one like WebStorm or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) where you 
can debug in the same IDE that you are editing in but there are [relatively clear instructions](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/inspector/) on how to get up and debugging on the NodeJS site.

## Getting Started

### Package.json

First thing we are going to do is make a ```package.json``` file.  

{% highlight json %}
{
    "name": "google-actions-rpsls",
    "description": "Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock as a Google Action",
    "version": "0.0.1",
    "dependencies": {
        "actions-on-google": "^1.7.0",
        "express": "^4.16.2",
        "body-parser": "^1.18.2",
        "ejs": "^2.5.7",
        "mongoose": "~4.13.6"
    },     
    "scripts": {
        "start": "node index.js"
    }
}
{% endhighlight %} 

First, lets download the dependencies, type:

```npm install``` 
 
Since there are no comments in JSON, let's go through the various dependencies.  

#### Actions on Google

Actions-on-google is the library from Google that is going to allow us to quickly communicate with Google Actions without having to manually parse all the input from Google Action, and having to write all the JSON responses.  It provides a fairly nice, and [relatively well documented](https://developers.google.com/actions/reference/nodejs/AssistantApp) API.

#### Express

Although actions-on-google appears to be designed for the [Google Cloud Platform Http Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/writing/http), according to documention, the Google Cloud Platform have the same properties as the ExpressJS [Request](http://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#req) and [Response](http://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res) objects.  Thus instead of installing the Google Cloud Platform simulator, or running on the Google Cloud Platform we can use [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com) instead.  

#### Body Parser

In version 4 of Express, it was componentized.  Body parser allow reading of the HTTP Posts and placing their contents in req.body, there are a lot of other
enhancements and niceties (serve-favicon, compression, session handling, etc) that could be added to improve the app but we'll leave those as exercises for the user to keep the code as simple as possible.  Note: The Actions on Google requires that body-parser be added as [middleware](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html) to Express or it will not work. 

#### Ejs

We are going to need a login page eventually, and I am using [EJS](http://ejs.co/) as the templating engine, we won't need it until a couple of articles down the line (in the third article in the series), but lets set up the package.json now.

#### Mongoose      
  
Eventually (once again, the third article of the series) we are going store our user accounts in Mongo, and [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/) is nice [ORM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping) wrapper around Mongo.

### RPSLS.json

Since our app is Rock Paper Lizard Spock we are going to use the acronym rpsls all over the place.  The first place we are going to do that is for the project.json file for Google Actions (or gactions).  Create a file ```rpsls.json``` and populate it with:

{% highlight json %}
{
  "actions": [
    {
      "description": "RPSLS Welcome Intent",
      "name": "MAIN",
      "fulfillment": {
        "conversationName": "main"
      },
      "intent": {
        "name": "actions.intent.MAIN"
      }  
    }
  ],
  "conversations": {
    "main": {
      "name": "main",
      "url": "https://CHANGE-ME.ngrok.io",
      "fulfillmentApiVersion": 2
    }
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}   

Note the CHANGE-ME in the conversations, eventually when we get your NGROK connection setup, you will have to change that URL.   
 
In the third article we are going to be adding to this file, to enable authentication, but for now this will do.  This file is currently divided into 2 sections, actions and conversations and only describes one action.  The actions described in [ActionPackage](https://developers.google.com/actions/reference/rest/Shared.Types/ActionPackage) are actions that are available without having started a conversation (we will code other Actions later, but they will not need to be described in the actions file since they are only available once a conversation is started).  Each action must have a name (according to the documentation they do not have a an intent or description if the name of the intent is a [built-in intent](https://developers.google.com/actions/reference/rest/intents), for example action.intent.MAIN -- but I haven't tested that), and should have an intent, a fulfillment and a description.  The fulfillment must have a field conversationName, and that has to point to a name in the conversations section.  

The conversations section has a collection of conversations, which have a name, a url and fulfillmentApiVersion.  Make sure the name of the conversation matches the collection name, and the fulfillmentApiVersion is set to 2 (Api 1 was very different, and will not be supported much longer and doesn't work with actions-on-google npm module).

### Set Up A Project

Go to the "Actions on Google Console" by going to [https://console.actions.google.com/](https://console.actions.google.com/).   

<img src="/img/google-home/step1.png" style="border: 1px solid #000; margin: 10px auto 0" />

Click on Add/Import Project, and call it rpsls.  Click on Create Project.

<img src="/img/google-home/step2.png" style="border: 1px solid #000; margin: 10px auto 0" />

Now click on the "Actions SDK" build button:

<img src="/img/google-home/step3.png" style="border: 1px solid #000; margin: 10px auto 0" />

And you will see that your project has been created.

<img src="/img/google-home/step4.png" style="border: 1px solid #000; margin: 10px auto 0" />

Now copy the piece of text from the second step and paste it into a command prompt where the active directory is the project root 
(the directory where you created the ```rpsls.json``` and ```package.json```) -- **don't hit return yet**.  It should look something like:

```gactions update --action_package PACKAGE_NAME --project rpsls-XXXXX```

Where the XXXXX will be a unique number assigned to you by Google.  Replace PACKAGE_NAME with rpsls.json and hit enter:

```gactions update --action_package rpsls.json  --project rpsls-XXXXX```

If everything goes right, you will be told (did you forget to [download](https://developers.google.com/actions/tools/gactions-cli) and place the gactions CLI in your path, if so do that now.)

```
Gactions needs access to your Google account. Please copy & paste the URL below into a web browser and follow the instructions there. Then copy and paste the authorization code from the browser back here.
Visit this URL:
 https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?access_type=offline&c.....
```

Once you have visited the URL paste the authorization code into the command prompt your app should be ready for testing.    Except we don't have an app.

### The First App

Create a new file index.js (of course you could call it app.js or google-actions.js or rpsls.js) in the root directory of our project.

{% highlight javascript %}
const ActionsSdkApp = require('actions-on-google').ActionsSdkApp;
const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');

const expressApp = express();

expressApp.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended: false}));
expressApp.use(bodyParser.json({extended: false}));

function mainIntentHandler(app) {
    app.ask('Hey Ma, It works!');
}

expressApp.use((request, response) => {
    console.log('Request body: ' + JSON.stringify(request.body));

    const actionApp = new ActionsSdkApp({
        request,
        response
    });

    // Map that contains the intents and respective handlers to be used by the
    // actions client library
    const actionMap = new Map();

    actionMap.set(actionApp.StandardIntents.MAIN, mainIntentHandler);

    actionApp.handleRequestAsync(actionMap).then(() => {
        console.log('Success handling GoogleAction request');
    }, (reason) => {
        console.error('Error: ' + JSON.stringify(reason));
    });
});


expressApp.listen(5050, () => console.log('Example app listening on port ' + 5050));
{% endhighlight %}

OK, the app is really simple at this point.  The first bit of code just loads the libraries and sets up Express (if you don't understand that part
of Node, Mozilla has great [tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Introduction) on getting started
with Node).  We set the main express [middleware function](http://expressjs.com/en/api.html#app.use) to be our actions SDK handler.
 
We could also just make this a [post handler](http://expressjs.com/en/api.html#app.post) like this:

{% highlight javascript %}
expressApp.post('/', (request, response) => {
{% endhighlight %}

Also if you are new to the whole ES6 thing, the lambda expression
is the same as:

{% highlight javascript %}
expressApp.post('/', function(request, response) {
{% endhighlight %}

Now lets look at what we are doing in our Middleware function (post handler, whatever you want to call it).  The log on the first line
is just so you can see what Google Actions is sending us each time.  It will look something like this:

{% highlight json %}

Request body: {
    "user":{
        "userId":"ABwppHH...cTfKaFJo",
        "locale":"en-US",
        "lastSeen":"2018-02-04T17:32:26Z"},
        "conversation":{
            "conversationId":"1517765608314",
            "type":"NEW"
        },
        "inputs":[
            {
                "intent":"actions.intent.MAIN",
                "rawInputs":[
                    {
                        "inputType":"VOICE",
                        "query":"talk to my test app"
                    }
                ]
            }
        ],
        "surface":{
            "capabilities":[
                {
                    "name":"actions.capability.AUDIO_OUTPUT"
                },
                {
                    "name":"actions.capability.MEDIA_RESPONSE_AUDIO"
                }
            ]
        },
        "isInSandbox":true
    }
    
{% endhighlight %}

which you will see shortly when you get your App up and running.  

Next we construct our actionsApp, there isn't any [documentation](https://developers.google.com/actions/reference/nodejs/ActionsSdkApp) for what you can send to the constructor,
but from the source code we can see is that the only three things it takes is a request, response, and sessionStarted function.  If you aren't 100% familiar with modern ES6 (ES2015)
syntax, note that 

{% highlight javascript %}
const actionApp = new ActionsSdkApp({
    request,
    response
});
{% endhighlight %}

is just [syntactic sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar) for

{% highlight javascript %}
const actionApp = new ActionsSdkApp({
    request: request,
    response: response
});
{% endhighlight %}        

Next we create Map of actions to event handlers.  And finally we handle the request based on the actionMap we created above.  Note that there are two ways
to handle the request, we could have also done the more succinct (and from what I have seen more common): 

{% highlight javascript %}
actionApp.handleRequest(actionMap);
{% endhighlight %}        

However, then you get no idea of what the error was when it happened, and usually just a not very useful unhandled promise request.  

Finally we have our very simple mainIntent handler which just speaks to the user ["Hey Ma, It Works"](https://ia801708.us.archive.org/BookReader/BookReaderImages.php?zip=/13/items/Basic_Computer_Language_Its_Easier_Than_You_Think_1978_Radio_Shack/Basic_Computer_Language_Its_Easier_Than_You_Think_1978_Radio_Shack_jp2.zip&file=Basic_Computer_Language_Its_Easier_Than_You_Think_1978_Radio_Shack_jp2/Basic_Computer_Language_Its_Easier_Than_You_Think_1978_Radio_Shack_0009.jp2).  The ask
function takes a lot of possible arguments, and has builders and we will get into the complexities of how it works in the next tutorial, but for now know that you
can send it is simple string and the Google Assistant will read it.  OK, now that we have a working script lets get this show on the road.

### Tunneling with NGrok.io

Since we are keeping things simple, and not requiring a VPS or doing something sketchy with our firewall or setting up [Dynamic DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_DNS) and since Google Actions wants to be on HTTPS, we are going to use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to forward HTTPS from the internet to our app running on port 5050 on our PC.   It is pretty self explanatory get setup with ngrok (follow the instructions on their site), and don't worry, for what we are doing it is completely free.  Once ngrok is installed, you have signed up with an account, start up a tunnel by typing:

```ngrok http 5050```

It will look something like:

```$xslt
ngrok by @inconshreveable                                                                                                                                                                                                                             (Ctrl+C to quit)

Session Status                online

```

Copy the https url (in this case https://dbbe2688.ngrok.io) and paste it into your rpsls.json converstation url:


{% highlight json %}
  "conversations": {
    "main": {
      "name": "main",
      "url": "https://dbbe2688.ngrok.io",  ⇐ CHANGE THIS LINE
      "fulfillmentApiVersion": 2
    }
  }
{% endhighlight %}

Now we have to tell Google Actions that we have change our url, so go back to the command line and type (where rpsls-XXXXX is the same project name you received earlier)

```gactions update --action_package rpsls.json  --project rpsls-XXXXX```

Wow, finally we are ready for testing!

### Finally, testing the app

We need to start the app up and running, which is as simple as 

```node index.js```

Eventually you might want to debug the app, either in WebStorm, Visual Studio Code or the Node Inspector, but be aware that you only get less than half a minute before the request times out and Google Assistant tells you that "my test app is not responding".

Hopefully if all went right, the app is up and running.

We want to go to our Google Actions console, [https://console.actions.google.com/](https://console.actions.google.com/) and pick our rpsls project.  In the Overview section hit "Test Draft".

We haven't set up the "App Information" on purpose, so our App will be called "My Test App".  Feel free to set this up, you will need a unique name for the app, as well as graphics, a description, a url for your privacy policy, etc.  In the third article in this series we will come back here to set up account linking, but for now we can just hit "Test Draft".

<img src="/img/google-home/step5.png" style="border: 1px solid #000; margin: 10px auto 0" />

You should see the simulator in all it's Glory.  In the input section type 

```"Talk to my test app"```

<img src="/img/google-home/step6.png" style="border: 1px solid #000; margin: 10px auto 0" />

If everything worked, you should see and hear "Hey Ma, It Works!"

<img src="/img/google-home/step7.png" style="border: 1px solid #000; margin: 10px auto 0" />

### Next Steps

Now that it is working on the simulator, you can test it on your own Google Home.  Note: The account you have logged in to your Google Home must be the account you are developing the App under.  The same is true for testing on a device, and remember unless you fill out the App Information the name of the App is "My Test App".

Ok, now that we have an app up and working, we'll start learning more about the actual ActionsAppSDK in the [next tutorial](/programming/2018/02/08/creating-a-google-home-app-part-2-the-game/)
 and build out our program to actually play a game.  While you are waiting, you might want to start messing around with the program we have created.  
 Perhaps asking more questions, or instead of using plain text use [SSML](https://developers.google.com/actions/reference/ssml) (Speech Synthesis Markup Language ) to make more complex speech.
   The methods available to the app object in the GoogleActionsSDK are documented [here](https://developers.google.com/actions/reference/nodejs/ActionsSdkApp#methods).  Until next time, have fun!

Oh, and all the code for this project can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/kriserickson/google-actions-rpsls).  This first article is is divided into 2 tags if you want to follow along,
first there is generating the [JSON files](https://github.com/kriserickson/google-actions-rpsls/tree/PART_1_STEP_1), and finally the full code for this article is
