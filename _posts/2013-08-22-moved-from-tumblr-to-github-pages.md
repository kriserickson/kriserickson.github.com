I've moved my blog from [Tumblr](http://tumblr.com/) to [Github](http:kriserickson.github.io).  Why?
A bunch of reasons:

1. I have lost too many posts to mention (and I don't blog a lot) to Tumblr's web interface.
1. I really like the idea of writing in Markdown in my favorite editor, not using some web interface (yes I've
tried [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/).  As good as HTML editors have gotten, I am always fighting against
them.
1. Github is awesome and github pages are free.
1. I can control the the look of the blog pretty easily, and just add pages as I want.

As you can see from the footer, the blog is static pages powered by Jekyll using the neat [Jekyll-Bootstrap framework](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/).
