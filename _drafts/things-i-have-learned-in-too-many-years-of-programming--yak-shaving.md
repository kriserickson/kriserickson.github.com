A lot of people consider [Yak Shaving](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/YakShavingDefinedIllGetThatDoneAsSoonAsIShaveThisYak.aspx)
 to be the bane of their existence, I admit that sometimes I find a perverse
pleasure in task of setting up, or maintaining an environment.  I am one of those people who will always update
their tooling to be the latest and greatest, and frequently suffer because of it.  I have been living on the
[JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/) EAP's for [PHPStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/) and
[IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) for years now, even though it probably costs me productivity in the long
run between the time it takes to keep the app's updated, dealing with the odd bugs that are yet to be squashed before
release and sometimes forgetting that when you install a new version of any of the IntelliJ editors always remember to
do File|Invalidate Caches (pro tip).  In the good old days of DOS games I remember spending hours playing with 
config.sys to eak out an extra few Kilobytes for the game.  

All that being said, it is one thing to do this on your own time, it is another to waste a client or employers
time messing around with your environment, trying out new languages or frameworks.  Here is where being the
[duct-tape programmer](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2009/09/23.html) is essential.  Work with what you
are most efficient with and what you know best and get the job done.  Of course make it as clean and elegant as
possible, but this is not the time to go off trying the newest javascript framework.
