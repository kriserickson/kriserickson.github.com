So I am doing some iPhone programming, and thus, I am working in XCode.  Wow, this thing brings me back to when
I was working at [Triumf](http://www.triumf.ca/) in the mid 90's and working in
X-Designer 4 on VMS.  Ok, they do seem to have most of the features of a modern IDE (we don't have a Refactor menu in
1996, I am sure), but wow is it hard to find anything without the help of the [goog](http://google.com).

I mean, obviously comment out a line would be on some menu that looked like a a very wide S (eventually I
discovered this was User Scripts).  Really?  Shouldn't features like Comment Out, Clean and Build, etc have
migrated to an actual menu item rather than a User Script?  Don't get me started about the default behavior of End and
Home keys on the Mac, but I recognize that isn't XCode's fault but that of the Mac in general
(and it isn't that hard to [fix](http://lifehacker.com/software/keyboard/mac-switchers-tip--remap-the-home-and-end-keys-225873.php)).

It just seems to me that XCode looks like an ugly abandoned stepchild when compared to Visual Studio, and that for a
company that is all about elegance, design and beauty they sure serve their developers a bit of a shit sandwich.
