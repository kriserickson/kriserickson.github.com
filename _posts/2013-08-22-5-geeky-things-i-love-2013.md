[It's two years later](/lifehacks/2011/07/21/5-geeky-things-i-love/) and time to re-evaluate or just expand upon the things I love.  Some have staid the same, some have changed.

1. [Rdio](http://rd.io) - Still loving it, oh yes it has issues (*cough* playlists *cough*, *cough* social *cough*) but it is constantly getting better and still is an amazing value for money..
1. [Jetbrains IDE's](http://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/) - Note only does [PHPStorm](http://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/) make programming in PHP
a pleasure, but [Intellij Idea](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) makes Java not seem so convoluted with it's ridiculously verbose syntax which isn't so bad when
IDEA autocompletes it for you.
1. [Nexus 7](http://www.google.ca/nexus/7/) - The right size for a tablet, the right price, and android is really hitting it's stride.
1. [Github](http://www.github.com/) - Github is awesome, and it's not awesome because of Git (maybe it is even in spite of Git, not that Git isn't awesome but it does
have a pretty steep learning curve) but because someone finally figured a non-gimicky way to make coding at least slightly social.  I know how much I love Github because
every time I have to download code from somewhere that isn't Github I die a little inside (especially *cough* Sourceforge *cough*).
1. [Javascript](http://javascript.crockford.com/) - Whether it is [nodejs](http://nodejs.org/) and [express](http://expressjs.com/), [angular](http://angularjs.org/), [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) or
any of the hundreds of modules on [npm](https://npmjs.org/) I just enjoy working on Javascript, and yes, I still love [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) even though
[none of the cool kids are using it anymore](http://vanilla-js.com/).

What's changed, you may notice I have switched from the [Kindle](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002Y27P3M/ref=sv_kinh_0) to the Nexus 7 for ebooks.  I also still
have, but have no love for my iPhone (months later I am still trying to find a way to get an unlocked [HTC One](http://shopamerica.htc.com/cell-phones/productdetail.htm?prId=41599)),
it's not that the iPhone is bad, it's just how locked down Apple has made the ecosystem.  And cygwin is no longer the band-aid I need for Windows, though it looks like
[major surgery](http://fedoraproject.org/) is going to be required there to make command line developing acceptable on windows - but that is another blog post.
