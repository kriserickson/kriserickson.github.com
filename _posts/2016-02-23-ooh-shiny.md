After almost three years running on [Jekyll-Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/), and getting the feeling that [The Minimum](https://github.com/jekyllbootstrap/theme-the-minimum) theme wasn't doing it for me any more, I've bit the bullet and switched to a stock Jekyll build.  You can see [it](https://github.com/kriserickson/kriserickson.github.com) in my GitHub repo.  It's based off of [Notepad](http://www.hossainmohdfaysal.com/Notepad/) by [@hmfaysal](https://twitter.com/hmfaysal), and I'm quite pleased with it.  Only took a few minutes to switch (thank god for MarkDown).  Though I probably should have switched to a [node](https://nodejs.org) based static site generator like [Wintersmith](http://wintersmith.io/) or [Surge](https://surge.sh/), the ease of switching made it seem like work to figure out if I could keep my permalinks in the same place in with a different system.  Plus the number of free templates available for Jekyll just made it a no-brainer.  And I probably won't have to dig into [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) too much, so the language of the tooling isn't that important.  In fact I've taken my old rakefile pretty much verbatum from my previous site, all I did was rip out the JekyllBootstrap theming tasks.

So here it is, the new look blog -- hope you enjoy, and hope that the change hasn't messed up the formatting too much.  Oh, and yes I will be abusing the feature image thing **waay** to much in the near future.
