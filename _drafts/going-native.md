Regular readers of this blog, or a casual reader who has looked at [my posts](http://www.agingcoder.com/categories/) will quickly realize that I am a big fan of [hybrid apps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5_in_mobile_devices#Hybrid_Mobile_Apps).  I have written extensively on the [various frameworks](http://www.agingcoder.com/programming/2014/04/22/the-state-of-html-mobile-frameworks-in-2014/index.html), [Phonegap and Cordova](http://www.agingcoder.com/programming/2015/02/21/lessons-learned-from-5-years-of-phonegapcordova-development/index.html) and even on the rise of [Mobile Native JavaScript](http://www.agingcoder.com/programming/2015/10/15/second-thoughts-on-nativescript-react-native-and-mobilenativejavascript-in-general/index.html) apps (shockingly MNJS never took off as an acronym).  I found a new love for Javascript 5 years ago or so (after a decade of hating it), and the thought of writing a complete App in Java or Objective C filled me with dread.  My earlier experiences with both Android and iOS had been worlds of pain, mostly because, in my option,  [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/) and [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) are hostile programming environments.  Most of my Android work over the past couple of years has been maintenance of old projects, always in [Intellij](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) and when I have to do plugin work for Cordova for iOS I always try to do it in [AppCode](https://www.jetbrains.com/objc/).

I tried doing some work with [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/tools) when it first came out, but [Gradle](http://gradle.org/) for Android was so buggy and the integration with Android Studio so incomplete at the time I stuck with Intellij and reliable ant builds.  But about a year ago I had to make a Q&D little mobile App that only had to run on Android and I thought I would give Android Studio a second try.  Wow, the difference a year made -- now don't get me wrong, Gradle builds in studio is still is slow as hell (and I have yet to see [Android Studio 2](http://android-developers.blogspot.ca/2015/11/android-studio-20-preview.html) fulfill the goals of fast compilation and hot-loading but I have faith).  The improvements to Android Studio present in 1.5 make it a real option for quickly building an Android App that really seemed to be missing until this point in time.  Instead of needing to be a master of tricks, kludges, external libraries, and of Android minutia to create a nice looking app, all you have to do is use the templates and wizards built into Android and out of the box you get a modern looking application.  Java is still a ridiculously verbose language, but autoComplete, Live Templates, and other Intellij magic built in Android Studio help alleviate that situation, and if it gets truly terrible I guess I could switch to nicer language like [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/kotlin-android.html).

So I did my usual thing, and tried porting my [Recipe Folder](https://recipe-folder.com) to an Android app and wow was I impressed.  I actually managed to get 90% of the functionality going in about 5 hours, another 5 hours and it was looking much nicer than the Cordova App that is currently in the App Store.  The only real problem was at that point I had 10% left to finish (and as most programmers know the final 10% takes 90% of the time) and also I decided to add a bunch of new features because releasing a second total rewrite (I rewrote from [jQuery-Mobile](http://www.agingcoder.com/programming/2014/04/26/mobile-frameworks-jquery-mobile/index.html) to [Topcoat-Touch](http://topcoat-touch) last year) of the app without adding any features seemed like a bad idea.  So my grand rewrite in Native has been stalled for the past couple of months, as I keep adding new features.

In my switch back to Native Android development, and looking at the space with fresh eyes I have come up with the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly of native Android development.

#### The Good ####

* Great templates, wizard, and development environment.   First there is the fact that it is built on Intellij which I am a massive fan of, their refactoring, code completion, code navigation, local history, and a myriad of other features  The continuous code analysis provides amazing feedback (and really helps you learn about a lot of Android best practicies)  The preview engine is not perfect (sometimes the end result looks very different from the preview you are shown), but it is pretty good.
